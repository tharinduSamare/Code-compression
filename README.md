# Code-compression
Code compression and decompression with 8 methods using frequency based dictionary.

* This is done as an assignment under "EN3240: Embedded Systems Engineering" module.
* [Code-compression assignment-Instructions.pdf](https://github.com/tharinduSamare/Code-compression/blob/main/Code%20compression%20assignment%20-%20Instructions.pdf) document includes the details about the compression and decompression methods that were designed.
* [compress_1.cpp](https://github.com/tharinduSamare/Code-compression/blob/main/compress_1.cpp) includes the compreesion code only.
* [decompress_1.cpp](https://github.com/tharinduSamare/Code-compression/blob/main/decompress_1.cpp) includes the decompression code only.
* [SIM.cpp](https://github.com/tharinduSamare/Code-compression/blob/main/SIM.cpp) includes full design which can be compiled and run in terminal as specified in [Code-compression assignment-Instructions.pdf](https://github.com/tharinduSamare/Code-compression/blob/main/Code%20compression%20assignment%20-%20Instructions.pdf) document
